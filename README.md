# Contributing

As described in [the help](https://dystroy.org/miaou/help#Technical_Stack), Miaou is mostly coded in JavaScript. Stuff includes node, PostgreSQL, OAuth2, socket.io, WebRTC, express, Bluebird, Redis, Jade, Passport.js, hu.js, jQuery, sass/scss, Uglify-js, gulp, travis-ci, and nginx.

Many features are implemented as plugins, and that's where you should look first: [Plugin developpement](plugins/README.md).

If you have the ability and will to contribute, come and discuss with us. The best landing place is usually the [Miaou room](http://dystroy.org/miaou/1?Miaou) where you can ping @dystroy or @Florian.

Help is welcome but remember:

1. Come and discuss with us before to code
2. And, **always test before doing a pull request**.
