# Miaou

A chat server with authentication, persistent and searchable history, rich markdown formatting, video, private rooms, conversation highlighting, plugins, persisted notifications, and many other features.

**[Introduction/Gallery](http://dystroy.org/miaou/static/intro.html)**

You can see it in action or use it on http://dystroy.org/miaou (anybody can create a room for public or private use on this server).

To discuss the code and feature of Miaou, please come to [the dedicated room](http://dystroy.org/miaou/1?Miaou).

# Installing a server

A [vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) configuration is available to help you set up a development environment quickly. See more information at its [documentation](vagrant/vagrant.md).

If you prefer to use [docker](https://www.docker.com/) as development environment, its also available. See more information at its [documentation](docker/README.md).

If you want to install Miaou on your own, the installation documentation is available [here](installation.md).

And if you run your own server, please tell us.
