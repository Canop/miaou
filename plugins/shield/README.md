Shields are those small pictures commonly used on GitHub repositories to provide essential information like build passing.

Miaou can provide a shield directing your users towards the most relevant chat room for discussions related to your repository.

Miaou shields hold a small flag precising the room's language. If you want to provide support in several languages, you can of course use more than one shield.
