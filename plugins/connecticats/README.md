This plugin displays a picture while the browser is waiting for socket.io to connect (which doesn't normally happen on desktop browser but is frequently a few seconds on moble ones).

A new preference, `connecticats.list`, enables the feature and allow the selection of the list in which to randomly pick the pictures, among the ones available on the server (in the `/list` directory of the plugin).
